# parsivel2
A MATLAB toolbox for reading, plotting and manipulating OTT Parsivel2 disdrometer 'raw' data.

## Overview
The OTT Parsivel2 is a laser-optical disdrometer that measures the size and velocity of
hydrometeors (Loffler-Mang and Joss, 2000). Usually the sampling output is 1 min,
in a text file. The Parsivel2 provides the number of drops in a 32x32 size versus fall velocity matrix.
Additionally, the rain rate, radar reflectivity factor and other rain parameters are computed
from drop size distribution.
This toolbox include some functions for reading, plotting and manipulate the data.
